/*You are given two integers M and N,
You need to find the count of bits different in 
their binary representation.

For example:
---------------
M = 4 and N =6
Binary of 4 => 1 0 0
Binary of 6 => 1 1 0
Count of bits different are 1.

Input Format:
-------------
Two integers M and N

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, count of bits different


Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
2

Explanation:
------------
1 -> 0 0 1
4 -> 1 0 0 
		d s d

d-> different
s-> same

Now, count of d's is the answer.
